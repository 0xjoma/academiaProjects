# Secure Messaging System - Implementation Assessment

## Overview

This implementation provides a secure messaging system that enables confidential and verifiable message transmission between two parties using a hybrid cryptographic approach. The system combines RSA and DES encryption to achieve both security and efficiency, while ensuring message integrity and non-repudiation through digital signatures.

## Implementation Assessment

I believe I have successfully completed all requirements for this deliverable. Here's my detailed self-assessment:

### Core Requirements Met

I have implemented Model 1 using the PyCryptodome library as specified. The implementation:

- Correctly uses DES in OFB mode for message encryption
- Implements RSA with OAEP padding for key encryption
- Creates and verifies digital signatures using SHA-256 hashing
- Handles all file I/O operations as required
- Separates the ciphertext into three distinct components (C1, C2, C3)

### Security Features Implemented

The system successfully provides:

- Confidentiality through hybrid encryption
- Non-repudiation through digital signatures
- Message integrity verification
- Secure key management

### Functionality Verification

I have thoroughly tested the implementation and confirmed that it:

- Correctly reads the plaintext message from input file
- Successfully performs all encryption operations
- Properly writes encrypted components to separate files
- Accurately verifies signatures during decryption
- Either produces decrypted output file or rejection message as appropriate
- Handles errors gracefully with appropriate rejection responses

### Code Quality

The implementation demonstrates:

- Clear organization and structure
- Comprehensive documentation
- Proper error handling
- Adherence to security best practices
- Clear instructions for setup and usage

## Conclusion

Based on this assessment, I am confident that this implementation fully meets the deliverable requirements. The system successfully achieves the core objectives of secure, efficient, and verifiable message transmission while maintaining code quality and usability standards.
