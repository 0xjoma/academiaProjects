# RSA Implementation Self-Assessment

## RSA Encryption
**Rating: Completely Meets Expectations**

In my implementation, I have successfully met all the requirements for RSA encryption:

I implemented the core encryption through three main functions:
- `encrypt(n, e, M)`: Handles the core RSA encryption operation
- `RSA_encrypt()`: Manages file I/O and string conversions
- `modularExponent()`: Implements the repeated squares method

My code successfully:
- Takes plaintext input and converts it to the required integer format
- Applies the RSA encryption formula C = M^e mod n
- Handles the public key components (n, e) from hex format
- Uses the repeated squares method for efficient computation

I organized my code in a modular way, separating the core RSA operations from file handling and ensuring each function has a single, clear responsibility.

## RSA Decryption 
**Rating: Completely Meets Expectations**

For decryption, I implemented:
- The core decryption function `decrypt(n, d, C)`
- File handling through `RSA_decrypt()`
- Reused my `modularExponent()` function for consistent computation

My decryption implementation:
- Correctly processes the ciphertext back to plaintext
- Properly uses the private key components (n, d)
- Maintains consistency with the encryption module
- Successfully recovers the original message

I kept the code organization parallel to the encryption module, which makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

## Test Cases
**Rating: Completely Meets Expectations**

I implemented two comprehensive test cases in my main() function:

Test Case 1:
```python
plaintextFileName = "plaintext1.txt"
publicKeyFileName = "keyPub1.txt"
privateKeyFileName = "keyPri1.txt"
```

Test Case 2:
```python
plaintextFileName3 = "plaintext3.txt"
publicKeyFileName2 = "keyPub2.txt"
privateKeyFileName2 = "keyPri2.txt"
```

Running the tests is straightforward:
1. Execute `python RSA.py`
2. The program automatically runs both test cases
3. Results are saved in the results/ directory
4. Original and decrypted files can be compared to verify success

Both test cases run successfully, demonstrating:
- Correct encryption of plaintext
- Proper handling of different key pairs
- Successful decryption back to original text
- Proper file I/O operations

## Overall Assessment
I believe my implementation fully meets the requirements specified in the rubric. My code:
- Correctly implements both encryption and decryption
- Uses a clear, modular structure
- Properly implements the repeated squares method
- Includes working test cases with clear instructions

While there are areas where the implementation could be enhanced (such as adding padding schemes or supporting larger messages), these improvements are beyond the scope of the current requirements. The core functionality meets all specified criteria successfully.
